# Cyber Security News Feed

This project aims to create an aggregated new feed for cyber security related news.
main.py will constantly monitor rss feeds from your selected news websites. You must 
enter the link to the rss feeds you want within the update_sql() function. The program 
will display new articles as they appear within a simple GUI.

This is meerly version 1 and I plan to update function of both the GUI and retrieval mechanisms.

TODO (For now):
1. Modernize GUI.
2. Display new articles at the top of the scrollbar
   rather than the bottom.
3. Supply dates with each entry.
